## Wait what I don't know grunt or all that crap!

Dont worry there are easy to use installers out there, to set it all up.

### Mac OSX
I recommend **ALL** my friends to Homebrew, it's easy, it's protected and don't jinx your system.
To install follow the instructions on this page
http://brew.sh/#install

***PLEASE NOTE THAT IT WILL ALSO INSTALL XCODE COMMAND LINE TOOLS***

### Windows
Oh well, there is something alike that too on Windows
It's called Chocolatey, it's pretty delicious

The things you need to install is:
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (YES REALLY!!!)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) 
- [Grunt.JS](http://gruntjs.com/)
